# Google HashCode PlayGround

This project allows to evaluate your submissions for past editions of Google HashCode. 
This is a work in progress, so far I fully implemented the scoring systems of:
- 2017 Final round
- 2017 Qualification round
- 2016 Final round
- 2016 Qualification round

Notice that submission files must be valid because the validation algorithms are only partially implemented.
